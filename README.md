# Food-Safety-Portal
The application provides details and specific information about the number of restaurants in a
particular city a user is visiting to get a better idea of food-based information in that locality.
It also includes categorizing the restaurants on the basis of certain classifications such as
local diet, education, delicious type of food(Italian, chinese, south-Indian, beverages).It acts
as a user guide which provides additional information with ratings of restaurants (with a
maximum of 5) along with menu details and discount facilities of each restaurant. Managers
of the restaurants are allowed to update information about their hotels. The visitors are
allowed to give review about the hotels they visited and can also mention any important
details which the hotel management can implement as a part of service. Application provides
the number of branches of a restaurant(if any) and also gives details about their location with
their certification. Information about any illness issues are also accepted from the user which
helps us in improving the application.
